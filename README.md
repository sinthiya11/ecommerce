# E-Commerce Website

This is a simple e-commerce website developed using React and Redux for state management.

## Code Structure

The project follows a standard React project structure:

src/
|-- components/ # Reusable UI components
|-- pages/ # Individual pages of the application
|-- redux/ # Redux related files (actions, reducers, slices)
|-- App.js # Main entry point of the application
|-- index.js # Root file to render the React app


## Development Choices

- *React*: Chosen for building the user interface due to its component-based architecture and efficiency in handling dynamic content.

- *Redux*: Used for state management to maintain a centralized store for the application's data, especially for handling the shopping cart and its interactions.

- *React Router*: Utilized for navigation within the application, allowing users to move between different pages.

- *Styling*: Applied simple inline styles for components to keep styles close to the component code. Utilized Bootstrap for some pre-built styles.

- *Responsive Design*: Ensured that the application is responsive and works well on various screen sizes.

- *Routing*: Implemented navigation between the home page and the cart page using React Router.
